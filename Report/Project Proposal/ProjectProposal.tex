\maketitle
Personalized search results and recommendations rely heavily on the profile of the user. Profile can be defined as a collection of information that captures the person's interests and likes based on his/her activities, behavior, the places frequented, the kind of food consumed and most importantly the profile of the user's friend circle. In this project we propose to build a user's profile by researching on the ways to analyze the geo-tagged socio-temporal data of the user as well as related/connected users. The broad goal that this project aims to shoot at is to be able to associate the user with certain \enquote{tags} which can then be used by other applications to provide relevant search results and recommendations.
